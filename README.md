# PUS2020_GSM
Sawyer-Morris Repository for PUS2020 course
My name is @Ginnie Sawyer-Morris, I am a 5th year doctoral student in the Human Development and Family Sciences department and my current research centers on gender differences in women's and men's recovery from substance use disorder.

I hope to streamline my workflow when it comes to using coding to manipulate and analyze data; I also hope to learn more about python.
